# Differential Expression Analysis

This folder contains scripts and resources for performing **Differential Expression (DE) Analysis** as part of the study, **"Expression divergence in response to sex-biased selection"**. Each script is designed to generate specific figures or tables included in the study.

## Overview

The analyses in this folder investigate various properties of genes differentially expressed between Red male-selected and NonRed female-selected gene pools, including:
- Sex-biased gene expression
- Correlations between experimental and control groups
- Gonad specificity of differentially expressed genes
- Masculinization or feminization of gene expression

## File Descriptions

Below is a summary of the scripts in this folder:

1. **[DE_SBGEdist_Fig2.S8.S9.R](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/blob/main/Analyses/DE_analysis/DE_SBGEdist_Fig2.S8.S9.R)**  
   Generates **Figure 2** and **Supplementary Figures S8 and S9**, visualizing the distribution of Red vs. NonRed DE genes based on sex-biased gene expression categories.

2. **[DErMF_Fig3.S10.S11.R](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/blob/main/Analyses/DE_analysis/DErMF_Fig3.S10.S11.R)**  
   Produces **Figure 3** as well as **Supplementary Figures S10 and S11**, comparing genetic correlations (rMF) between DE and background genes.

3. **[ExpCtrlEffect_Fig6A.S13.R](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/blob/main/Analyses/DE_analysis/ExpCtrlEffect_Fig6A.S13.R)**  
   Creates **Figure 6A** and **Supplementary Figure S13**, comparing evolutionary changes in gene expression between Red and NonRed pools.

4. **[GonadSpecificity_TableS6.R](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/blob/main/Analyses/DE_analysis/GonadSpecificity_TableS6.R)**  
   Generates **Table S6**, which compares gonad-specificity indices of DE genes (candidates vs. non-candidates).

5. **[MaleFemCorr_FigS7.R](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/blob/main/Analyses/DE_analysis/MaleFemCorr_FigS7.R)**  
   Produces **Supplementary Figure S7**, showing correlations between Red/NonRed changes in experimental samples versus control samples.

6. **[MascFemDE_Fig4.S12_TableS7.R](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/blob/main/Analyses/DE_analysis/MascFemDE_Fig4.S12_TableS7.R)**  
   Generates **Figure 4**, **Supplementary Figure S12**, and **Table S7**, analyzing the masculinization and feminization of gene expression in Red and NonRed samples.
