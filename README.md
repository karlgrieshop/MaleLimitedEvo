## Background

In six replicate populations of 1000 flies, a dominant marker (DsRed) was used to force a “Red” pool of genetically variable Chromosome 2 copies through exclusive father-to-son inheritance, while a complimentary pool of “NonRed” chromosomes was inherited primarily from mothers to daughters. After 100 generations, we demonstrated the effect of Red male-limited chromosomes in increasing male mating success. We analysed differentially expressed genes with and without Red chromosomes.
